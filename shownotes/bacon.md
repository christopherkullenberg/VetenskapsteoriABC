s. 16 ff - Induktion


Idolerna; Aforism 39 och framåt (1, s. 40ff):

*The idols of the tribe are founded in human nature itself and in the very tribe or race of mankind.*

*The idols of the cave are the illusions of the individual man. For (apart from the aberrations of human nature in general) each man has a kind of individual cave or cavern which fragments and distorts the light of nature.*

*[...] Idols of the marketplace; we take the name from human exchange and community. Men associate through talk; and words are chosen to suit the understanding of the common people. And thus a poor and unskilful code of words incredibly obstructs the understanding.*

*Finally there are the illusions which have made their homes in men’s minds from the various dogmas of diﬀerent philosophies, and even from mistaken rules of demonstration. These I call idols of the theatre, for all the philosophies that men have learned or devised are, in our opinion, so many plays produced and performed which have created false and fictitious worlds.*

Om grekerna, Aforism 71: 
*Nearly all the sciences we have come from the Greeks. Additions by Roman, Arabic or more recent writers are few and of no great significance; such as they are, they rest on a foundation of Greek discovery. However, the wisdom of the Greeks was rhetorical and prone to disputation, a genus inimical to the search for truth.* (1, s. 58)


Bi-metaforen, Aforism 95, (1, s. 79)

Those who have treated of the sciences have been either empiricists or
dogmatists. Empiricists, like ants, simply accumulate and use; Rationalists,
like spiders, spin webs from themselves; the way of the bee is in between:
it takes material from the flowers of the garden and the field; but it has the
ability to convert and digest them. This is not unlike the true working of
philosophy; which does not rely solely or mainly on mental power, and
does not store the material provided by natural history and mechanical
experiments in its memory untouched but altered and adapted in the
intellect. Therefore much is to be hoped from a closer and more binding
alliance (which has never yet been made) between these faculties (i.e. the
experimental and the rational
